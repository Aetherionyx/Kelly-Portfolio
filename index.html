                            In my spare time, I enjoy learning languages (current focuses being German, Spanish, Russian, and Ukranian), meeting new people, and traveling to new places â€” whether they be local or on a boat. Be it a festival or convention, I'm always excited to see who it is I'll meet someday.

                            Educational Background

                        <p>
                            While in univeristy, I took part in various extracurricular programs. When my initial college started a coding club, I fell in love with Python and managed to gain an introduction to SQL. After attending HCC, I was originally heading to University of South Florida to study information technology and took my first courses in Java, though that was the year COVID debuted and I quickly transferred to University of Phoenix as they had a well established online program in a critical time in my student career.
